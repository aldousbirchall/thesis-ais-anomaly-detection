	abstract = {Different spatial point process models and techniques have been developed in the past decades to facilitate the statistical analysis of spatial point patterns. However, in some cases the spatial point process methodology is scarce and no flexible models nor suitable statistical methods are available. For example, due to its complexity, the statistical analysis of spatial point patterns of several groups observed at a number of time instances has not been studied in-depth, and there are a few limited models and methods available for such data. In the present work, we provide a mathematical framework for coupling neural network methods with the statistical analysis of point patterns. In particular, we discuss an example of deep neural networks in the statistical analysis of highly multivariate spatial point patterns and provide a new strategy for building spatio-temporal point processes using variational autoencoder generative neural networks.},

	abstract = {Species are seldom distributed at random across a community, but instead show spatial structure that is determined by environmental gradients and/or biotic interactions. Analysis of the spatial co-associations of species may therefore reveal information on the processes that helped to shape those patterns. We propose a multivariate approach that uses the spatial co-associations between all pairs of species to find subcommunities of species whose distribution in the study area is positively correlated. Our method, which begins with the patterns of individuals, is particularly well-suited for communities with large numbers of species and gives rare species an equal weight. We propose a method to quantify a maximum number of subcommunities that are significantly more correlated than expected under a null model of species independence. Using data on the distribution of tree and shrub species from a 50 ha forest plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, we show that our method can be used to construct biologically meaningful subcommunities that are linked to the spatial structure of the plant community. As an example, we construct spatial maps from the subcommunities that closely follow habitats based on environmental gradients (such as slope) as well as different biotic conditions (such as canopy gaps). We discuss extensions and adaptations to our method that might be appropriate for other types of spatially referenced data and for other ecological communities. We make suggestions for other ways to interpret the subcommunities using phylogenetic relationships, biological traits and environmental variables as covariates and note that subcommunities that are hard to interpret may suggest groups of species and/or regions of the landscape that merit further attention.},

	abstract = {The 50-ha plot at Barro Colorado Island was initially demarcated and fully censused in 1982. Over 200,000 individual tropical trees were measured and mapped, but most demanding was the taxonomic component. Much collecting and sorting was done so that every individual could be matched to a previously described species from Croat's Flora of Barro Colorado (Stanford Univeristy, 1978). Over 300 taxa were separated and all but eight of those identified to species. After the 8th census in 2015, a total of 328 tree taxa have been documented in the plot, though the number alive in any one census has been less, always 296-303. Taxonomy of tropical plants, however, is still in a state of flux because many of the groups have not been studied in detail for decades, and new treatments, especially those using DNA phylogenies, invariably lead to revision and reidentification. To maintain the 50-ha plot up-to-date with recent taxonomy, we have had to make numerous changes to the original list of 300 species. In a 1996 paper (Journal of Tropical Ecology, v. 12, pp. 231-256), we listed every species and added an Appendix documenting revisions done up until that date. In a 2004 paper (Journal of Tropical Ecology, v. 20, pp. 51-72), another species list was provided, but with no list of revisions. Many other papers mention some species, but none since list all species. Here we provide a complete list after 20 years of further changes, plus a list of all obsolete names ever used with a link to the current valid name. We acknowledge, of course, that taxonomy continues and further revisions will be inevitable. Included here are two tables of species names assigned to tree taxa from the 50-ha plot at Barro Colorado. The first table has all 455 Latin names every used for the 328 plot species, including names appearing in Croat (1978) and Condit et al. (1996, 2004). For each name, the currently accepted name is provided. This table allows users to search for any name and determine its current status. The second table gives only the 328 currently accepted Latin names, with all prior names for each included. This second table is how results on tree species from the 50-ha plot should be presented in publications. This Smithsonian Archive is permanent and will always have the same object identifier (DOI). It was frozen as of 31 December 2017, so users will always be able to consult the 2017 version. The same taxonomic tables also appear online in a searchable and sortable format designed to let users explore the data easily (http://conditdatacenter.org/BCIPlotTaxonomy). That web site, however, is maintained by one of the PIs and is not guaranteed to be permanent, that is, after he retires from the project it will disappear.},

	abstract = {Transshipment at sea, the offloading of catch from a fishing vessel to a refrigerated vessel far from port, can obscure the actual source of the catch, complicating sustainable fisheries management, and may allow illegally caught fish to enter the legitimate seafood market. Transshipment activities often occur in regions of unclear jurisdiction where policymakers or enforcement agencies may be slow to act against a challenge they cannot see. To address this limitation, we processed 32 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) messages from ocean-going vessels from 2012 to the end of 2017 and identified and tracked 694 cargo vessels capable of transshipping at sea and transporting fish (referred to as transshipment vessels). We mapped 46,570 instances where these vessels loitered at sea long enough to receive a transshipment and 10,233 instances where we see a fishing vessel near a loitering transshipment vessel long enough to engage in transshipment. We found transshipment behaviors associated with regions and flag states exhibiting limited oversight; roughly 47\% of the events occur on the high seas and 42\% involve vessels flying flags of convenience. Transshipment behavior in the high seas is relatively common, with vessels responsible for 40\% of the fishing in the high seas having at least one encounter with a transshipment vessel in this time period. Our analysis reveals that addressing the sustainability and human rights challenges (slavery, trafficking, bonded labor) associated with transshipment at sea will require a global perspective and transnational cooperation.},

We present a global dataset of AIS disabling in commercial fisheries, which obscures up to 6\% ({\textgreater}4.9 M hours) of vessel activity. Disabling hot spots were located near the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of Argentina and West African nations and in the Northwest Pacific, all regions of IUU concern. Disabling was highest near transshipment hot spots and near EEZ boundaries, particularly contested ones. We also found links between disabling and location hiding from competitors and pirates.

	abstract = {Automatic identification systems (AISs) serve as a complement to radar systems, and they have been installed and widely used on ships to identify targets and improve navigation safety based on a very high frequency (VHF) data communication scheme. AIS networks have also been constructed to enhance traffic safety and improve management in main harbors. AISs record moving vessel trajectories, which include rich traffic flow information, and they represent the foundation for identifying locations and analyzing motion features. However, the inclusion of redundant information will reduce the accuracy of trajectory clustering; therefore, trajectory data mining has become an important research direction. To extract more useful information with higher accuracies and lower computational costs, trajectory mapping and clustering methods are combined in this work to explore big data acquired from AISs. In particular, the merge distance (MD) is used to measure the similarities between different trajectories, and multidimensional scaling (MDS) is adopted to construct a suitable low-dimensional spatial expression of the similarities between trajectories. An improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is then proposed to cluster spatial points to acquire the optimal cluster. A fusion of the MD, MDS and improved DBSCAN algorithms can identify the course of trajectories and attain a better clustering performance. Experiments are conducted using a real AIS trajectory database for a bridge area waterway to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experiments also show that the proposed method presents a higher accuracy than spectral clustering and affinity propagation clustering.},

	abstract = {Icebreaking activity and seasonal ice propose challenges for marine traffic prediction in the Baltic Sea. Traffic prediction is a vital part in the planning of icebreaking activities, but it remains largely as a manual task. The aim of this thesis is to examine factors influencing marine traffic modelling in ice-covered waters and propose a novel A*-based method for modelling traffic in ice. The current state of the marine traffic modelling and factors affecting vessel movement are concluded by examining the literature and historical vessel tracks. 
 
The field of traffic modelling research is growing rapidly. Currently the biggest challenges are evaluation of results and the lack of publicly available datasets. Moreover, the current approaches to model vessel movement in ice are promising but fail to capture how icebreaking activity influences vessel routes. 
 
The proposed model consists of sea, maneuverability, route and speed modelling. The model uses historical AIS data, topography of the sea, vessel type and dirways as main data inputs. The model is trained with summer tracks and dirways are used for modelling the ice channels kept open by icebreakers. The accuracy of the model is evaluated by examining route, speed, traffic and ETA (estimated time of arrival) prediction results separately. Moreover, the area between the actual and predicted route is introduced as an accuracy measure for route prediction.   
 
The model shows that winter route prediction can be improved by incorporating dirways to the modelling. However, the use of dirways did not affect the speed, traffic or ETA prediction accuracy. Finally, the datasets and source code used in this thesis are published online.},

	abstract = {Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) are a standard feature of ocean-going vessels, designed to allow vessels to notify each other of their position and route, to reduce collisions. Increasingly, the system is being used to monitor vessels remotely, particularly with the advent of satellite receivers. One fundamental problem with AIS transmission is the issue of gaps in transmissions. Gaps occur for three basic reasons: 1) saturation of the system in locations with high vessel density; 2) poor quality transmissions due to equipment on the vessel or receiver; and 3) intentional disabling of AIS transmitters. Resolving which of these mechanisms is responsible for generating gaps in transmissions from a given vessel is a critical task in using AIS to remotely monitor vessels. Moreover, separating saturation and equipment issues from intentional disabling is a key issue, as intentional disabling is a useful risk factor in predicting illicit behaviors such as illegal fishing. We describe a spatial statistical model developed to identify gaps in AIS transmission, which allows calculation of the probability that a given gap is due to intentional disabling. The model we developed successfully identifies high risk gaps in the test case example in the Arafura Sea. Simulations support that the model is sensitive to frequent gaps as short as one hour. Results in this case study area indicate expected high risk vessels were ranked highly for risk of intentional disabling of AIS transmitters. We discuss our findings in the context of improving enforcement opportunities to reduce illicit activities at sea.},

If a ship exhibits anomalous behaviour, this could indicate it is being used for illicit activities. With the wide availability of automatic identification system (AIS) data it is now possible to detect some of these patterns of behaviour. Monitoring the possible threat posed by the worldwide movement of ships, however, requires efficient and robust automatic data processing to create a priority list for further investigation. This paper outlines five anomalous ship behaviours: deviation from standard routes, unexpected AIS activity, unexpected port arrival, close approach, and zone entry. For each behaviour, a process is described for determining the probability that it is anomalous. Individual probabilities are combined using a Bayesian network to calculate the overall probability that a specific threat is present. Examples of how the algorithms work are given using simulated and real data.},

	abstract = {The characterization of ship routes and route similarity measurement based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data are topics of various scientific interests. Common route research approaches use available AIS identifiers of ship types. However, assessing route and similarity profiles for individual fleets requires collecting data from secondary sources, dedicated software libraries or the creation of specific methods. Using an open-source approach, public AIS and ship data, we evaluate route characteristics for the container ships of a single fleet in a six-month period, calling on two selected ports of the shipping line on the USA East Coast. We evaluate the routes in terms of length, duration and speed, whereas for the similarity measurement we employ the discrete Fréchet distance (DFD). The voyage length, duration and average speed distributions were observed to be moderately positive (0.77), negative (−0.62), and highly positively skewed based on the adjusted Fisher–Pearson coefficient of skewness (1.23). The most similar voyages were from the same ships, with the lowest discrete Fréchet distance similarity value (0.9 NM), whereas 2 different ships had the most dissimilar voyages, with the highest DFD value (14.1 NM). The proposed methodology enables assessment of similarities between individual ships, or between fleets.},

	abstract = {Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectories’ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80\% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency. The estimated compressed trajectories are 23\% more similar to their original trajectories compared to currently used simplification methods. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of the implemented hybrid method is 15.68\% higher than the ordinary Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network which is currently used by various maritime systems and applications, including collision avoidance, vessel route planning, and anomaly detection systems.},

Background: as port activities have a significant impact on the economic growth of these countries, it is necessary to constantly analyse and plan port activities, anticipate market changes and improve the ability of ports to withstand the growing general competitive pressure. This article analyses studies conducted by researchers on the topic of seaports, thus, and find that there are no analyses comparing more than two ports. Methods: a comparative analysis of the ports on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea was conducted using the analysis of statistical data. Results: The Baltic Sea is surrounded by nine countries. Four countries (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Russia) have different coasts and different numbers of seaports. In this article, according to the selected parameters, 10 ports on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea are analyzed. Conclusions: The comparative analysis of ports on the eastern Baltic Sea revealed that Klaipeda port is the most diversified port in the eastern Baltic Sea region, given that it does not have any single most important type of cargo. The largest ports in terms of bulk cargo are in Tallinn, Riga and Ventspils. Primorsk is the largest port for liquid cargo and St. Petersburg handles the greatest volumes of cargo of a general type and while the distribution of cargo flows in the port of Visotsk is best correlated with the selected parameters, which allows us to state that the infrastructure of this port is used to the maximum.},

Finally, edges connecting these waypoints form the final maritime traffic network.

	abstract = {The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a ship reporting system based on messages broadcast by vessels carrying an AIS transponder. The recent increase of terrestrial networks and satellite constellations of receivers is making AIS one of the main sources of information for Maritime Situational Awareness activities. Nevertheless, AIS is subject to reliability and manipulation issues; indeed, the received reports can be unintentionally incorrect, jammed or deliberately spoofed. Moreover, the system can be switched off to cover illicit operations, causing the interruption of AIS reception. This paper addresses the problem of detecting whether a shortage of AIS messages represents an alerting situation or not, by exploiting the Received Signal Strength Indicator available at the AIS Base Stations (BS). In designing such an anomaly detector, the electromagnetic propagation conditions that characterize the channel between ship AIS transponders and BS have to be taken into consideration. The first part of this work is thus focused on the experimental investigation and characterisation of coverage patterns extracted from the real historical AIS data. In addition, the paper proposes an anomaly detection algorithm to identify intentional AIS on-off switching. The presented methodology is then illustrated and assessed on a real-world dataset.},

	abstract = {Understanding maritime traffic patterns is key to Maritime Situational Awareness applications, in particular, to classify and predict activities. Facilitated by the recent build-up of terrestrial networks and satellite constellations of Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers, ship movement information is becoming increasingly available, both in coastal areas and open waters. The resulting amount of information is increasingly overwhelming to human operators, requiring the aid of automatic processing to synthesize the behaviors of interest in a clear and effective way. Although AIS data are only legally required for larger vessels, their use is growing, and they can be effectively used to infer different levels of contextual information, from the characterization of ports and off-shore platforms to spatial and temporal distributions of routes. An unsupervised and incremental learning approach to the extraction of maritime movement patterns is presented here to convert from raw data to information supporting decisions. This is a basis for automatically detecting anomalies and projecting current trajectories and patterns into the future. The proposed methodology, called TREAD (Traffic Route Extraction and Anomaly Detection) was developed for different levels of intermittency (i.e., sensor coverage and performance), persistence (i.e., time lag between subsequent observations) and data sources (i.e., ground-based and space-based receivers).},

	abstract = {Global Positioning System technology has been widely used in vehicle tracking and road planning applications. An enormous amount of data concerning the trajectories of vehicles has been collected and stored for tracking purposes. A trajectory contains not only the footprints of a moving object but also additional information, such as speed and stopping points. Therefore, the large-scale trajectory data sets provide rich information and are currently attracting considerable attention; there have been many successful studies of event detection based on trajectory data. However, most of these studies have focused only on vehicles traveling in a road network and have note considered maritime trajectories. A maritime trajectory also contains auxiliary data (e.g., speed and rotation) in addition to the movements of a ship. However, ships are not bound to road networks, and consequently, it is difficult to apply traditional mining algorithms based on road networks. In addition, even if the amount of maritime trajectory data is very large, these data are also spatially sparse, which will significantly reduce the effectiveness of most existing mining algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new method of abnormal trajectory detection to address this problem. This method can detect abnormal vessel trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS), records for vessels via our feature learning algorithm. To reduce the search space, we invoke reference points as well as the Piecewise Linear Segmentation (PLS), algorithm to compress the trajectories without losing important information. A time-aware and spatially correlated collaborative algorithm is proposed to increase the density of the trajectories to improve the accuracy of the detection algorithm, which is based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Finally, we report experiments conducted on a real-world data set, which demonstrate that the proposed detection method can detect anomalous trajectories effectively.},

This research proposes a data integration approach to construct Global Shipping Networks (GSN) from massive historical ship AIS trajectories in a completely bottom-up way. First, a DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm is applied to temporally identify relevant stop locations, such as marine terminals and their associated events. Second, the semantic meanings of these locations are obtained by mapping them to real ports as identified by the World Port Index (WPI). Stop events are leveraged to develop travel sequences of any ship between stop locations at multiple scales. Last, a GSN is constructed by considering stop locations as nodes and journeys between nodes as links. This approach generates different levels of shipping networks from the terminal, port, and country levels. It is illustrated by a case study that extracts country, port, and terminal level Global Container Shipping Networks (GCSN) from AIS trajectories of more than 4000 container ships in 2015. The main features of these GCSNs and the limitations of this work are finally discussed.},

	abstract = {The long term prediction of maritime vessels' destinations and arrival times is essential for making an effective logistics planning. As ships are influenced by various factors over a long period of time, the solution cannot be achieved by analyzing sailing patterns of each entity separately. Instead, an approach is required, that can extract maritime patterns for the area in question and represent it in a form suitable for querying all possible routes any vessel in that region can take. To tackle this problem we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to cluster vessel position data obtained from the publicly available Automatic Identification System (AIS). The resulting clusters are treated as route waypoints (WP), and by connecting them we get nodes and edges of a directed graph depicting maritime patterns. Since standard clustering algorithms have difficulties in handling data with varying density, and genetic algorithms are slow when handling large data volumes, in this paper we investigate how to enhance the genetic algorithm to allow fast and accurate waypoint identification. We also include a quad tree structure to preprocess data and reduce the input for the GA. When the route graph is created, we add post processing to remove inconsistencies caused by noise in the AIS data. Finally, we validate the results produced by the GA by comparing resulting patterns with known inland water routes for two Dutch provinces.},

	abstract = {Estimating the future position of a deep sea vessel more than 24 hours in advance is a major challenge for Dutch logistics service providers (LSPs). Their unscheduled arrival in ports directly impacts scheduling and waiting times of barges, propagating throughout the entire supply chain network. To help LSPs' planners improve planning operations, we intend to capture the characteristics of maritime routes for a specific region (the North Sea connecting the Netherlands and United Kingdom) in the form of a directed graph, which can be used as a foundation for predicting destination and arrival time of each associated vessel. To create such graph we need an efficient way to extract waypoints for traffic data and this is the problem we will address in this paper. Since LSPs only use publicly available data for arrival estimation, our solution is entirely based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Extracting positional information from AIS, we explore various machine learning approaches to identify clusters. We apply DBSCAN algorithm and show its advantages and disadvantages when used on AIS data. The same process is repeated using meta-heuristics, comparing clustering results generated by a genetic algorithm and by modified ant-colony optimization to those produced by DBSCAN. Finally, we present a hybrid approach and its ability to discover waypoints, highlighting the achieved improvements. To extend the problem, two constraints are added. The first is the requirement to handle large volumes of streaming AIS data on standard PC-based hardware. The second introduces the common situation of "dark areas" in a map due to problems with receiving and transmitting AIS data. The algorithm discovers route waypoints in efficient and effective ways under these constraints.},

	abstract = {Effective barge scheduling in the logistic domain requires advanced information on the availability of the port terminals and the maritime traffic in their vicinity. To enable a long-term prediction of vessel arrival times, we investigate how to use the publicly available automatic identification system (AIS) data to identify maritime patterns and transform them into a directed graph that can be used to estimate the potential trajectories and destination points. To tackle this problem, we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to cluster vessel position data. Then, we show how to enhance the process to allow fast computation of incremental data coming from the sensors, including the importance of adding a quad tree structure for data preprocessing. Focusing on a real case implementation, characterized by partially incomplete and noisy AIS data, we show how the algorithm can handle routes intersecting the regions with missing data and the repercussions this has on the route graph. Finally, postprocessing is explained that handles graph pruning and filtering. We validate the results produced by the GA by comparing resulting patterns with known inland water routes for two Dutch provinces followed by the simulation using synthetic data to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.},

	abstract = {Motivated by new technologies, such as Internet of Things, Big Data, Cloud Computing, data-driven based smart maritime related research is attracting more and more attention. With the establishment of China Automatic Identification System (AIS) Asia-Pacific Data Center and its network with IALA-Net, worldwide ship trajectory data is becoming increasingly available, thus providing plenty of materials for data-driven based smart maritime researches. This paper presents a novel approach to automatic maritime routing algorithm, given a set of ship trajectories, infer a routable road network by combining data-driven based algorithms, specially by focusing on: (i) After appropriate pre-processing, simplify AIS trajectory data using Douglas-Peucker algorithm, which can simplify AIS trajectory data by extracting characteristic points, in the meanwhile, compressing redundant information and improving subsequent processing efficiency. (ii) By setting similarity metric of characteristic points, cluster them using DBSCAN algorithm, consequently, deduce general behavior and spatial pattern of trajectories following the similar route. Also, the turning nodes of routes can be obtained in this step. Unlike past published works that focus on partitioned trajectory and require dense-sampling, trajectory point based method proposed in this paper has the merits of robustness to noise and disparity, low computational complexity and space complexity. (iii) Determine the connectivity of turning nodes according to ship trajectories. In this step, isolated turning nodes are linked together to form a coherent chain modeled as a directed graph. (iv) Given a starting location, infer the optimal route to the destination using Ant Colony Algorithm. By comparing the main route generated automatically and the macroscopic traffic flow situation, the result indicate that the method proposed in this paper is effective.},

	abstract = {Building a rich and informative model from raw data is a hard but valuable process with many applications. Ship routing and scheduling are two essential operations in the maritime industry that can save a lot of resources if they are optimally designed, but still, need a lot of information to be successful. Past and recent works in the field assume the availability of information such as the birth time-windows, cargo volumes, and container handling productivity at ports and cruising speed. They employ navigation maps that contain information about the major sailing paths and have knowledge about bigger or smaller ports and offshore platforms. In this work, we present a methodology for extracting information about the navigation network for an area, using data from the trajectories of multiple vessels, which are collected using the Automatic Identification System (AIS). We introduce a method for identifying the points of major interest to the trajectory of a vessel and two clustering techniques for identifying: i) key areas in the monitored region such as ports, platforms or areas where vessels change their course (e.g., capes); and ii) the speed and course patterns of ships of a particular type when they follow a typical route. The resulting information is modeled using a network abstraction where nodes correspond to the areas identified by the first clustering technique. After, edges are enriched with information about the groups extracted using the second clustering technique. The first analysis on a real dataset in the area of the eastern Mediterranean sea demonstrates the capabilities of the proposed model and the information it can provide. The use of the model in an outlier behavior detection task also shows interesting results.},

AIS messages are transmitted as broadcasts to nearby ships and contain, among others, information about the identification, position, speed, and course of the sending vessels. AIS can thus serve as a tool to avoid collisions and increase onboard situational awareness. In recent years, AIS has been utilized in more and more applications since it enables worldwide surveillance of virtually any larger vessel and has the potential to greatly support vessel traffic services and collision risk assessment. Anomalies in AIS tracks can indicate events that are relevant in terms of safety and also security. With a plethora of accessible AIS data nowadays, there is a growing need for the automatic detection of anomalous AIS data. In this paper, we survey 44 research articles on anomaly detection of maritime AIS tracks. We identify the tackled AIS anomaly types, assess their potential use cases, and closely examine the landscape of recent AIS anomaly research as well as their limitations.},

This work presents a data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model, based on Gaussian Processes, to model normal shipping behaviour. This model is learned from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and uses an Active Learning paradigm to select an informative subsample of the data to reduce the computational complexity of training. The resultant model allows a measure of normality to be calculated for each newly-observed transmission according to its velocity given its current latitude and longitude. Using this measure of normality, ships can be identified as potentially anomalous and prioritised for further investigation. The model performance is assessed by its ability to detect artificially generated AIS anomalies at locations around the United Kingdom. Finally, the model is demonstrated on case studies from artificial and real vessel data to detect anomalies in unusual tracks.},

Correction for this is essential if the aim is to assess the evidence for 'clustering' of cases of disease. We examine methods for exploring spatial variation in disease risk, spatial and space-time clustering, and we consider methods for modelling the raised incidence of disease around suspected point sources of pollution. All methods are illustrated by reference to recent case studies including child cancer incidence, Burkitt's lymphoma, cancer of the larynx and childhood asthma.

The approach automatically groups historical traffic data provided by the Automatic Identification System in terms of ship types, sizes, final destinations and other characteristics that influence the maritime traffic patterns off the continental coast of Portugal. The approach consists of identifying relevant waypoints along a route where significant changes in the ships’ navigational behaviour are observed, such as changes in heading, using trajectory compression and clustering algorithms. This provides a vector-based representation of the ship routes consisting of straight legs and connecting turning sections that facilitates route probabilistic characterization and anomaly detection. The maritime traffic is characterized probabilistically at the identified route legs and waypoints in terms of lateral distribution of the trajectories and speed profile, which allows the characterization of the typical behaviour of a group of similar ships along a particular route. In the proposed approach heading changes are automatically detected using the Douglas and Peucker algorithm and clustered by the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm. The proposed method is applied to the characterization of southbound maritime traffic from the traffic separation scheme off Cape Roca to the ports of Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines. Finally, an example of ship trajectory anomaly detection based on the developed maritime traffic probabilistic models is provided.},

The navigational and hydrographic conditions of navigation on each section of the route determine the requirements for the accuracy of observations and the time spent on locating the vessel. The problem of predicting the trajectory of the vessel’s motion in automatic mode is especially important for river vessels or river-sea vessels, predicting the trajectory of the route sections during the maneuvering of the vessel. At the moment, one of the most accurate ways of determining the coordinates of the vessel is by reading the satellite signal. However, when a vessel is near hydraulic structures, problems may arise connected with obtaining a satellite signal due to interference and, therefore, the error in measuring the coordinates of the vessel increases. The likelihood of collisions and various kinds of incidents increases. In such cases, it is possible to correct the trajectory of the movement using an autonomous navigation system. In this work, opportunities of the possible application of artificial neural networks to create such a corrective system using only the coordinates of the ship’s position are discussed. It was found that this is possible on sections of the route where the ship does not maneuver.},

With the increasing availability and completeness of ship positioning data from the global Automated Identification System (AIS), it is possible to derive more timely and detailed trade statistics for homogeneous commodity groups. The objective of this article is twofold: (1) to compare the accuracy of AIS-derived trade statistics to official customs data in the crude oil market and (2) to add a breakdown of trade by vessel size over time. We find that while AIS-derived data for seaborne crude exports show good alignment with official export numbers in aggregate, there are substantial temporal and geographical differences across countries and time due to the use of pipelines and transshipment in parts of the supply chain. We highlight the challenges in properly structuring and aggregating micro-level cargo data. Our findings are important for the proper derivation of shipping demand from trade data.},

	abstract = {Transportation networks play a crucial role in human mobility, the exchange of goods and the spread of invasive species. With 90 per cent of world trade carried by sea, the global network of merchant ships provides one of the most important modes of transportation. Here, we use information about the itineraries of 16 363 cargo ships during the year 2007 to construct a network of links between ports. We show that the network has several features that set it apart from other transportation networks. In particular, most ships can be classified into three categories: bulk dry carriers, container ships and oil tankers. These three categories do not only differ in the ships' physical characteristics, but also in their mobility patterns and networks. Container ships follow regularly repeating paths whereas bulk dry carriers and oil tankers move less predictably between ports. The network of all ship movements possesses a heavy-tailed distribution for the connectivity of ports and for the loads transported on the links with systematic differences between ship types. The data analysed in this paper improve current assumptions based on gravity models of ship movements, an important step towards understanding patterns of global trade and bioinvasion.},

	abstract = {The increasing pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies (GPS, GSM networks, etc.) enables people to conveniently log their location history into spatial-temporal data, thus giving rise to the necessity as well as opportunity to discovery valuable knowledge from this type of data. In this paper, we propose the novel notion of individual life pattern, which captures individual's general life style and regularity. Concretely, we propose the life pattern normal form (the LP-normal form) to formally describe which kind of life regularity can be discovered from location history; then we propose the LP-Mine framework to effectively retrieve life patterns from raw individual GPS data. Our definition of life pattern focuses on significant places of individual life and considers diverse properties to combine the significant places. LP-Mine is comprised of two phases: the modelling phase and the mining phase. The modelling phase pre-processes GPS data into an available format as the input of the mining phase. The mining phase applies separate strategies to discover different types of pattern. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using GPS data collected by volunteers in the real world to verify the effectiveness of the framework.},

Although the continuous research effort, only a few works explicitly study the evolution of such graphs and often consider coarse-grained time intervals. In this context, our ultimate goal is to fill this gap by providing a systematic study in the graph evolution by considering voyages over time. By mining the arrivals and departures of vessels from ports, we build a graph consisting of vessel voyages between ports. We then provide a study on topological features calculated from such graphs with a strong focus on their temporal evolution.

The past decade has witnessed the success of deep learning in processing image, voice and text data. However, its application in movement pattern detection is not fully exploited. To address the research gap, this paper develops a deep learning approach to detect regional dominant movement patterns (RDMP) in trajectory data. Specifically, a novel feature descriptor called directional flow image (DFI) is firstly proposed to store the local directional movement information in trajectory data. A DFI classification model called TRNet is designed based on convolutional neural network. The model is then trained with a synthetic trajectory dataset covering 11 classes of commonly encountered movement patterns in reality. Finally, a sliding window detector is built to detect RDMP at multiple scales and a clustering-based merging method is proposed to prune the redundant detection results. Training of TRNet on the synthetic dataset achieves considerably high accuracy. Experiments on a real-world taxi trajectory dataset further demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach in discovering complex movement patterns in trajectory data.},

Nowadays, there is a need for prominent solutions capable of mining information from messy and multidimensional road traffic data sets with few modeling constraints. In that sense, we propose a unique and versatile model to address different major challenges of traffic forecasting in an unsupervised manner. We formulate the road traffic forecasting problem as a latent variable model, assuming that traffic data is not generated randomly but from a latent space with fewer dimensions containing the underlying characteristics of traffic. We solve the problem by proposing a variational autoencoder (VAE) model to learn how traffic data are generated and inferred, while validating it against three different real-world traffic data sets. Under this framework, we propose an online unsupervised imputation method for unobserved traffic data with missing values. Additionally, taking advantage of the low dimension latent space learned, we compress the traffic data before applying a prediction model obtaining improvements in the forecasting accuracy. Finally, given that the model not only learns useful forecasting features but also meaningful characteristics, we explore the latent space as a tool for model and data selection and traffic anomaly detection from the point of view of traffic modelers.},

The third category explores the correlation between traffic flow values by using concepts from pattern analysis. We explain and discuss example solutions for each category, and we outline perspectives on open questions and research challenges.

	abstract = {Expert interpretation of anatomical images of the human brain is the central part of neuroradiology. Several machine learning-based techniques have been proposed to assist in the analysis process. However, the ML models typically need to be trained to perform a specific task, e.g., brain tumour segmentation or classification. Not only do the corresponding training data require laborious manual annotations, but a wide variety of abnormalities can be present in a human brain MRI — even more than one simultaneously, which renders a representation of all possible anomalies very challenging. Hence, a possible solution is an unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) system that can learn a data distribution from an unlabelled dataset of healthy subjects and then be applied to detect out-of-distribution samples. Such a technique can then be used to detect anomalies — lesions or abnormalities, for example, brain tumours, without explicitly training the model for that specific pathology. Several Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based techniques have been proposed in the past for this task. Even though they perform very well on controlled artificially simulated anomalies, many of them perform poorly while detecting anomalies in clinical data. This research proposes a compact version of the “context-encoding” VAE (ceVAE) model, combined with pre and post-processing steps, creating a UAD pipeline (StRegA), which is more robust on clinical data and shows its applicability in detecting anomalies such as tumours in brain MRIs. The proposed pipeline achieved a Dice score of 0.642 ± 0.101 while detecting tumours in T2w images of the BraTS dataset and 0.859 ± 0.112 while detecting artificially induced anomalies, while the best performing baseline achieved 0.522 ± 0.135 and 0.783 ± 0.111, respectively.},

In this context, deep learning-based auto encoders have shown great potential in detecting anomalies in medical images.

We address these shortcomings by proposing the Context-encoding Variational Autoencoder (ceVAE) which combines reconstruction- with density-based anomaly scoring. This improves the sample- as well as pixel-wise results. In our experiments on the BraTS-2017 and ISLES-2015 segmentation benchmarks, the ceVAE achieves unsupervised ROC-AUCs of 0.95 and 0.89, respectively, thus outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin.},

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this article, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find a member of that family which is close to the target density. Closeness is measured by Kullback–Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this article is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {This study presents a deep learning framework to support regional ship behavior prediction using historical AIS data. The framework is meant to aid in proactive collision avoidance, in order to enhance the safety of maritime transportation systems. In this study, it is suggested to decompose the historical ship behavior in a given geographical region into clusters. Each cluster will contain trajectories with similar behavior characteristics. For each unique cluster, the method generates a local model to describe the local behavior in the cluster. In this manner, higher fidelity predictions can be facilitated compared to training a model on all available historical behavior. The study suggests to cluster historical trajectories using a variational recurrent autoencoder and the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise algorithm. The past behavior of a selected vessel is then classified to the most likely clusters of behavior based on the softmax distribution. Each local model consists of a sequence-to-sequence model with attention. When utilizing the deep learning framework, a user inputs the past trajectory of a selected vessel, and the framework outputs the most likely future trajectories. The model was evaluated using a geographical region as a test case, with successful results.

	abstract = {Automatic identification system (AIS) refers to a new type of navigation aid system equipped in maritime vehicles to monitor ship performance. It provides trajectory information of vessels which can be used for the classification task. The classification results facilitate ocean surveillance and conservation, vessel management enhancement, fishery regulation, marine ecological sustainability, and nautical safety protection. Some progresses have been made based on machine learning or deep learning strategies to perform supervised learning by assuming that during the training process, the category labels of historical trajectory data are available. However, in reality, the label information may be difficult or expensive to obtain, resulting in that only a small part of the training data is labeled, and most of the training data is unlabeled. To address this issue, this paper proposes a semi-supervised deep learning approach to integrate the knowledge of unlabeled data for vessel trajectory classification. Here, we call our approach SSL-VTC. Specifically, we first extract vessel trajectories by integrating the kinematic and static information from historical AIS messages. Then, we design convolutional neural networks to extract feature representations from the vessel trajectories. Finally, we develop a semi-supervised learning algorithm based on the variational autoencoder to perform discriminative learning and generative learning simultaneously. In this way, our SSL-VTC framework can fully leverage the labeled data and unlabeled data during the training process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize semi-supervised learning for vessel trajectory classification. Experimental results on the public AIS dataset show that our SSL-VTC can effectively extract feature representations from the AIS messages and its performance is significantly better than the traditional supervised learning methods. The approach and findings of this study provide important implications for researchers and stakeholders in the field of ocean management.

However, abnormal trajectories of maritime transportation ships can have highly negative impacts on the management of IoT-MTS. Therefore, anomaly detection of trajectories is important for the successful deployment of IoT-MTS. In this paper, we propose a Transfer Learning based Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy, named TLTAD, for IoT-MTS. Specifically, a variational autoencoder is used to discover the potential connections between each dimension of the normal trajectory, while a graph variational autoencoder is used to explore the spatial similarity between normal trajectories. Based on internal connection of trajectories, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is employed to train the trajectory anomaly detection model. To reduce the model training time, transfer learning is used to migrate the trained anomaly detection model between different regions of an ocean area or between similar ocean areas. Moreover, an efficient data transformation module is designed to improve the efficiency of model transfer. The experiments were conducted on a real-world automatic identification system (AIS) dataset. The results indicate that the proposed TLTAD can provide accurate anomaly detection on ships' trajectories in IoT-MTS with reduced model training times.},

An unsupervised generative framework utilizing a variational autoencoder (VAE) is proposed in this work in order to create better disentangled representations for the downstream classification task. The disentanglement is further enforced using a hyperparameter {\textbackslash}beta . For the purpose of better segregating the spectro-temporal features, an intermediate non-linearly scaled time-frequency representation is also employed in conjunction with {\textbackslash}beta -VAE. Experimental analysis of various classifier configurations yields encouraging results in terms of data efficiency and classification accuracy on target records collected from various locations of the Indian Ocean.},

To solve the optical inspection problem in unrestricted environments with no special lighting and without the existence of error-free reference boards, we propose a new beta-variational autoencoder (beta-VAE) architecture for anomaly detection that can work on both integrated circuit (IC) and non-IC components. We show that the proposed model learns disentangled representation of data, leading to more independent features and improved latent space representations. We compare the activation and gradient-based representations that are used to characterize anomalies and observe the effect of different beta parameters on accuracy and untwining the feature representations in beta-VAE. Finally, we show that anomalies on solder joints can be detected with high accuracy via a model trained directly on normal samples without designated hardware or feature engineering.},

At present, the deep learning method based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) has emerged for time series anomaly detection. However, this method needs to find the best mapping from real-time space to the latent space at the anomaly detection stage, which brings new errors and takes a long time. In this paper, we propose a long short-term memory-based variational autoencoder generation adversarial networks (LSTM-based VAE-GAN) method for time series anomaly detection, which effectively solves the above problems. Our method jointly trains the encoder, the generator and the discriminator to take advantage of the mapping ability of the encoder and the discrimination ability of the discriminator simultaneously. The long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are used as the encoder, the generator and the discriminator. At the anomaly detection stage, anomalies are detected based on reconstruction difference and discrimination results.

Most previous methods are based on reconstruction models, and use anomaly score calculated by the reconstruction error as the metric to tackle anomaly detection. However, these methods just employ single constraint on latent space to construct reconstruction model, resulting in limited performance in anomaly detection. To address this problem, we propose a Spatial–Contextual Variational Autoencoder with Attention Correction for anomaly detection in retinal OCT images. Specifically, we first propose a self-supervised segmentation network to extract retinal regions, which can effectively eliminate interference of background regions. Next, by introducing both multi-dimensional and one-dimensional latent space, our proposed framework can then learn the spatial and contextual manifolds of normal images, which is conducive to enlarging the difference between reconstruction errors of normal images and those of abnormal ones. Furthermore, an ablation-based method is proposed to localize anomalous regions by computing the importance of feature maps, which is used to correct anomaly score calculated by reconstruction error. Finally, a novel anomaly score is constructed to separate the abnormal images from the normal ones. Extensive experiments on two retinal OCT datasets are conducted to evaluate our proposed method, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

Such predictions can serve as a decision support tool to evaluate the future risk of ship collisions. Inspired by generative models, the method suggests to predict the future trajectory of a vessel based on historical AIS data. Using unsupervised learning to facilitate trajectory clustering and classification, the method utilizes a cluster of historical AIS trajectories to predict the trajectory of a selected vessel. Similar methods predict future states iteratively, where states are dependent upon the prior predictions. The method in this study, however, suggests predicting an entire trajectory, where all states are predicted jointly. Further, the method estimates a latent distribution of the possible future trajectories of the selected vessel. By sampling from this distribution, multiple trajectories are predicted. The uncertainties of the predicted vessel positions are also quantified in this study.},

The multi-class anomaly framework captures AIS message dropouts due to various reasons, e.g., channel effects or intentional one for carrying illegal activities. We extract position, speed, course and timing information from real world AIS data, and use them to train a 2-class (normal and anomaly) and a 3-class (normal, power outage and anomaly) anomaly detection models.

	abstract = {This paper addresses the challenges of detecting anomalies in cellular networks in an interpretable way and proposes a new approach using variational autoencoders (VAEs) that learn interpretable representations of the latent space for each Key Performance Indicator (KPI) in the dataset. This enables the detection of anomalies based on reconstruction loss and Z-scores. We ensure the interpretability of the anomalies via additional information centroids (c) using the K-means algorithm to enhance representation learning. We evaluate the performance of the model by analyzing patterns in the latent dimension for specific KPIs and thereby demonstrate the interpretability and anomalies. The proposed framework offers a faster and autonomous solution for detecting anomalies in cellular networks and showcases the potential of deep learning-based algorithms in handling big data.},

	abstract = {AIS data include ship spatial-temporal and motion parameters which can be used to excavate the deep-seated information. In this article, an interpretable knowledge-based decision support method is established to guide the ship to make collision avoidance decisions with good seamanship and ordinary practice of seamen using AIS data. First, AIS data is preprocessed and trajectory reconstructed to restore the ship historical navigation state, and a ship encounter identification model is constructed according to the encounter characteristics; Second, a two-stage collision avoidance behavior extraction algorithm is formed to build a behavior knowledge base, and the scenario similarity model is constructed to measure and match similar scenarios based on ship position, motion tendency and collision risk. Then, the Delaunay Triangulation Network is used to fuse ship trajectories of similar scenario to form the collision avoidance path. Finally, a case study is performed using the real AIS data outside Ningbo-Zhoushan Port waters, China, and the effectiveness of the planned path is verified by setting the head-on and crossing situations and comparison between the planned and real paths. Results indicate that the proposed model can extract the ship collision avoidance behavior accurately, and the planned path can ensure navigation safety.},

	title = {{SecureAIS} - {Securing} {Pairwise} {Vessels} {Communications}},
	doi = {10.1109/CNS48642.2020.9162320},
	abstract = {Modern vessels increasingly rely on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) digital technology to wirelessly broadcast identification and position information to neighboring vessels and ports. AIS is a time-slotted protocol that also provides unicast messages-usually employed to manage self-separation and to exchange safety information. However, AIS does not provide any security feature. The messages are exchanged in clear-text, and they are not authenticated, being vulnerable to several attacks, including forging and replay. Despite the existing contributions in the literature propose some strategies to overcome the exposed weaknesses, some are insecure, others do not comply with the standard, while the remaining few ones would introduce an unacceptable overhead-that is, they would require a relevant number of AIS-time slots, because of the limited payload available for each time-slot. In this paper, we propose SecureAIS, a key agreement scheme that allows any pair of vessels in reach of an AIS radio to agree on a shared session key of the desired length, by requiring just a fraction of the AIS time-slots of competing solutions. Further, the scheme is fully standard compliant and does not require any modification to the available hardware. The proposed scheme integrates the Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) implicit certification scheme and the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) key agreement technique, requiring moderate computational overhead while enjoying an optimal usage of the available bandwidth. When configured with the highest security level of 256 bits, SecureAIS allows two AIS transceivers to agree on a shared session key in 20 time-slots, against the 96 time-slots required by the competing solution based on traditional X.509 certificates. The proposed solution has been implemented and tested in a real scenario, while its security has been formally evaluated through the ProVerif tool. Finally, the source code of our Proof-of-concept using GNURadio and Ettus Research X310 has been also released as open-source to pave the way to further research by both Industry and Academia in maritime communication security.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},
